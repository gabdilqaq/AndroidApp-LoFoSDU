Hello, this is an android application.
In this application, users can post and view lost and found items on the university campus.
I didn't connected the app to any database yet. So here is only UX/UI. I used RecyclerView, FrameLayout, ActionBar, ConstraintLayout, LinearLayout, DrawerLayout, BottomNavigation and many other views.
